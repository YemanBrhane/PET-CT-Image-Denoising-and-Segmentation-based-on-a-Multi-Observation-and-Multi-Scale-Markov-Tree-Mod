# PET-CT Image Denoising and Segmentation based on a Multi Observation and Multi Scale Markov Tree Mod

Applied Wavelets and Contourlet transforms to denoise Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and computed
tomography (CT). Wavelet fusion was applied on CT and PET, and tested for multi-modality image segmentation in order to take
advantage of the high resolution of the morphological CT image and the high contrast of the functional PET
image. Adopted Hidden Markov Tree for segmentation with initial segmentation generated using k-means clustering
